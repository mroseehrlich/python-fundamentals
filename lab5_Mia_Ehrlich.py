# This program introduces the Lame Game, displays a welcome message with a brief
# description of the game and an option menu for gaming rooms. Input validation
# ensures that the user picks only options 1, 2, 3, or 4 from the menu list.
# If user chooses menu option 1, they play the make change game, which prompts the user
# for the cost of an item, the amout paid, confirms that the amout paid is more
# than the cost, then calculates change back in dollars, quarters, nickels,
# dimes, and pennies.
# If user chooses menu option 2, they play the high card game which asks for the
# names of two players, asigns a random card to be drawn for each player, then
# displays each card drawn and the winner with the higher card. 
# The gaming option menu displays again after one round of either game.
# If user chooses option 3, they play the Deal Hand game, which deals five cards and
# displays their respective values.
# If user chooses option 4, the game ends.
# All code is organized into functions called by the main driver function
